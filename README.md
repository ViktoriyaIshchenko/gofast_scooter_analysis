# Analysis of User and Trip Data from GoFast Scooter Rental Service  

## Project Description  
This project analyzes user and trip data from the GoFast scooter rental service. The goal is to investigate usage patterns and validate hypotheses that could help the business grow. GoFast users can choose between two usage plans:  
1. **Pay-as-you-go**:  
   - No subscription fee.  
   - Trip cost: 8 RUB per minute.  
   - Start cost: 50 RUB.  
2. **Ultra subscription**:  
   - Monthly subscription fee: 199 RUB.  
   - Trip cost: 6 RUB per minute.  
   - No start cost.  

The project aims to answer key business questions related to user behavior, trip distance, revenue, and customer support efficiency.  

## Objectives  
1. Analyze user and trip data to understand usage patterns.  
2. Validate the following hypotheses:  
   - Users with a subscription spend more time on trips.  
   - The average distance traveled by subscription users per trip does not exceed 3130 meters (optimal distance for scooter wear and tear).  
   - Monthly revenue from subscription users is higher than from non-subscription users.  
   - The number of support requests will significantly decrease after server upgrades.  

## Dataset Description  
The dataset contains information about users, their trips, and business-relevant metrics.  

## Steps of Analysis  
1. **Data Overview**:  
   - Explore the dataset structure and check for missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Clean the data and address inconsistencies.  
   - Calculate additional metrics such as cost per trip and revenue per user.  

3. **Data Analysis**:  
   - Analyze user behavior, trip durations, and distances.  
   - Evaluate revenue trends and support request patterns.  

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:  
   - Use statistical methods to test the hypotheses.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations for business growth.  

## Tools Used
